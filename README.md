# Bridges-working-group

## Working Group Aim

The aim of the Bridge working group is to support the development of cross-chain decentralized bridges between Cardano and other chains. This Working Group will foster the development of CIPs and other proposals (new features, enhancements..) to enhance mainnet bridging to Cardano that are appropriate to the community's needs. These proposals will also serve as a blueprint to onboard other bridge partners.

* Advice and help to document CIPs and other proposals from inception to implementation.
* Advice and help for all aspects of the development and implementation of each proposal.
* Advice and help to identify and prioritize backlog of work
* Advice and help to aggregate and reconcile all comments, suggestions and feedback for all deliverables
* Advice and help to provide input and coordinate comments from the Cardano community
* Create a public (github, live meetings) forum for the discussion of these issues and projects
