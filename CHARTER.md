   5. New members 


This is a community-led initiative so we encourage members of the Cardano community who want to  support the development of cross-chain decentralized bridges between Cardano and other chains to join the Bridge Working Group starting by joining the Discord Channel 


1. Join our discord server (use this link), and verify.
2. Submit your discord handle in this single-field form
3. Access will be granted within 24hrs.




5. Communications


Members of the Bridges Working Group are committed to a high standard of public behavior and strive to treat every person with respect.


* Channels: https://discord.gg/inputoutput 




6. Decision Making 


Consensus/Voting/Approval. Each Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus. Where the Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Bridge Working Group will make that decision by a supermajority vote of the Working Group Participants, as applicable.




7. Repository and Deliverable Development 


   6. Process 
The repository is designed to simplify and consolidate GitHub status tracking of work items managed by the Bridges Working Group. 


Proposed workflow


1. Idea:  Any Working Group member may submit a proposed idea as a candidate. This will be raised as an issue in Github. The Working Group will agree if they want to work on this.


2. Pre-Draft. If The Working Group decides to work on one of the ideas, a member will create a branch that points to the corresponding issue and uploads one or more documents (as text markdown files). Then the Working Group members work on the documents until a first draft is complete.


3. Draft. Once the documents are ready for review, a Pull Request is created, assigning at least two reviewers. 


4. Review. The Working Group members will review the documents and make any comments or suggestions. An iterative process starts with the interaction between reviewers and the draft’s editors.


5. Working Group Approval. Once every comment is solved and reviewers are happy with the documents, the PR is approved. Then the branch is ready to be merged into the master branch.
